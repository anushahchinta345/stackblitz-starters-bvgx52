            </p>

            <p>
                In earlier chapters, we’ve dealt mostly with functional React components that do not require state
                management. This chapter’s main focus is on state, its management and components that utilise it in
                React.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-1">
            <h2>
                What is State?
            </h2>

            <p>
                State is a JavaScript object that stores a component’s dynamic data and determines the component’s
                behaviour. Because state is dynamic, it enables a component to keep track of changing information in
                between renders and for it to be dynamic and interactive.
            </p>

            <p>
                State is similar to props but unlike props, it is private to a component and is controlled solely by the
                said component. In the examples from previous chapters, the behaviour of components has primarily
                depended on the props that are passed down to them. In those cases, the components that receive the
                props have no control over them because props are read-only.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-2">
            <h2>
                Adding State to a Class Component
            </h2>

            <pre>
                class Greeting extends React.Component {
                    render(){
                      return &lt;h1&gt;
